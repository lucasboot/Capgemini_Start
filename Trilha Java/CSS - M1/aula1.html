        <p>
            Squid are a type of cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight
            arms and two tentacles. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a
            mantle. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasfva/">They are mainly soft-bodied</a>, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a
            rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.
            Squid diverged from other cephalopods during the Jurassic and occupy a similar role to teleost fish as open
            water predators of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The
            two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it.
